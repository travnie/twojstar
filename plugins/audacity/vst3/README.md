# Audacity VST3

Cross-platform VST3 **audio effects** aimed first at Audacity and usable in other compatible hosts.

## Auto Declip 0.1

The first released effect is intentionally conservative. Its repair pipeline handles short full-scale clipping plateaus, isolated single-sample impulse clicks, and narrow mains hum without pretending that severely missing audio can be recovered by a magic button.

Current detector/repair rules:

- clipping threshold: `|sample| >= 0.995`,
- repair only consecutive runs of **2–32 samples**,
- the declipping stage preserves isolated full-scale samples unless the de-click stage sees strong smooth-context evidence for a one-sample impulse,
- de-click requires two smooth context samples on each side and leaves multi-sample transients alone,
- longer clipping is preserved for a future stronger restoration stage,
- de-hum uses narrow Q=35 notches at 50/60 Hz plus 100/120 and 150/180 Hz harmonics,
- de-hum adds no algorithmic latency and resets its filter state after a non-finite sample,
- audio outside the narrow repair bands remains effectively transparent; broadband `Denoise` is exported as an explicit VST3 on/off parameter and defaults to **Off**,
- repaired runs are reconstructed between clean edges with a bounded peak-shaped interpolation,
- output is capped just below full scale,
- fixed **66-sample pipeline latency** (64 declip + 2 de-click), reported to the VST3 host,
- mono and stereo, 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point processing,
- fixed memory only in the audio path; no allocations, files, network or model loading.

### De-noise core prototype

`DeNoiseDsp` is a separate conservative broadband downward expander for low-level stationary noise. It uses fixed-memory envelope/gain smoothing, has no algorithmic latency, never hard-mutes the floor, and resets safely after non-finite input. It is wired behind the explicit `Denoise` VST3 parameter, defaults to **Off**, and the selected state is stored with the host project/preset. Quiet ambience and reverb tails are therefore not altered unless the user enables broadband repair.

### Audacity host validation

On **Audacity 4.0**, Travny Auto Declip passes the current host-validation matrix: plug-in scanning/discovery succeeds, the effect loads, Audacity's fallback/generated parameter UI exposes `Denoise`, the toggle starts **Off** and can be switched **On**, Apply succeeds, and Audacity remains responsive afterward. The dedicated VST3 state round-trip regression also passes, confirming that the serialized `Denoise` state survives component/controller save-and-restore.

Reopening the destructive effect creates a fresh effect instance, so seeing `Denoise` return to its default **Off** state in a newly opened effect window is expected host lifecycle behavior. It is not evidence that VST3 state serialization failed.

## Smart Transition 0.1 prototype

Smart Transition is the first implementation from the [`../smart-edit/`](../smart-edit/) track. It targets the little click/thump/level jump left after a cut or join.

The prototype is deliberately deterministic DSP first:

- 100 ms bounded lookahead, clamped to 1024–8192 samples,
- mono/stereo shared seam detection without signed cross-channel cancellation,
- block-partition-independent candidate ordering and score quantization,
- short local DC and level matching,
- a bounded S-curve/Hermite bridge around the accepted seam,
- one high-confidence seam per VST3 processing run,
- exact same-format determinism tests across arbitrary input chunking,
- no allocation, network, model loading or background helper in the audio path.

The effect currently uses conservative fixed defaults while the host contract is being validated. The planned `Mode`, `Max transition`, `Strength` and `Repair` host parameters are still required before calling 0.1 release-ready.

### Why it is not in Latest yet

CI builds and packages `TravnySmartTransition.vst3` for Windows and Linux as an **experimental workflow artifact**, but the repository-wide rolling **Latest** release intentionally does not publish it yet.

Generic VST3 `ProcessData` does not provide a portable end-of-selection marker. The host-independent DSP core can finalize a late seam and shrink context for a short selection when its caller invokes `drainFrame()`, but the current VST3 adapter does not capture such a boundary and only calls `processFrame()`. End-of-selection behavior therefore remains a release gate even though the validated Audacity fixture below produces the expected output.

Windows host validation on **Audacity 3.7.9** now passes discovery, Preview, Apply, Undo, cancellation, and host responsiveness. An 80-frame stereo fixture at 48 kHz with its seam at frame 40 was processed end-to-end: Apply preserved all 80 output frames and repaired the seam, validating Audacity's observed output for this specific case. Preview → Stop → Cancel left no Smart Transition undo entry, and the next Apply produced byte-identical PCM to the earlier Apply, confirming state reset and deterministic reprocessing for the same fixture.

Audacity 4.0 has not yet been claimed as equivalent Smart Transition processing validation here. Any 4.0 scan/discovery evidence should be treated as host recognition only until Preview/Apply behavior and the end-of-selection contract are explicitly exercised there.

Before promotion, the adapter or host test harness must explicitly exercise end-of-selection handling for late seams and short selections, different real host block sizes must produce the same plan/output contract, and the planned `Mode`, `Max transition`, `Strength`, and `Repair` parameters remain required for 0.1. Until those gates pass, the workflow ZIP stays a development artifact rather than a supported release.

## Released packages

Ready-to-copy Auto Declip packages are published in the repository-wide GitHub **Latest** release:

- [Windows x64](https://github.com/travnie/twojstar/releases/latest/download/audacity-auto-declip-windows.zip)
- [Linux x64](https://github.com/travnie/twojstar/releases/latest/download/audacity-auto-declip-linux.zip)

Each archive contains the `TravnyAutoDeclip.vst3` bundle plus a tiny `INSTALL.txt`. On Windows x64, copy the `.vst3` bundle to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`; on Linux, use your standard VST3 plug-in directory. Then rescan effects in Audacity. The repository does not install a background helper and the plug-ins perform no runtime downloads.

Both DSP cores are independent of the VST3 SDK so they can be unit-tested on Windows and Linux without the host adapter.

## Build the DSP tests only

No third-party SDK is needed:

```bash
cmake -S plugins/audacity/vst3 -B plugins/audacity/vst3/build -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build plugins/audacity/vst3/build --config Release
ctest --test-dir plugins/audacity/vst3/build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

## Build the VST3 effects

Use a separately reviewed Steinberg VST3 SDK 3.8+ checkout. The repository does **not** download or execute an SDK at configure time.

```bash
cmake -S plugins/audacity/vst3 -B plugins/audacity/vst3/build-sdk \
  -DVST3_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/vst3sdk \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=ON \
  -DSMTG_CREATE_PLUGIN_LINK=OFF
cmake --build plugins/audacity/vst3/build-sdk --config Release \
  --target TravnyAutoDeclip TravnySmartTransition
```

CI pins Steinberg VST3 SDK **3.8.0** by commit and checks its submodules recursively on both Windows and Linux. VSTGUI and SDK examples are disabled because neither effect needs them.

## Product rules

- **Format:** VST3 audio effect.
- **Language:** C++20.
- **Build:** CMake is the source of truth.
- **Targets:** Windows x64 and Linux x64 first; macOS can follow without redesigning DSP.
- **Runtime:** local/offline, deterministic, no telemetry/login/background service/runtime download.
- **UI:** host parameters first; custom GUI only when an effect genuinely needs one.
- **Performance:** bounded memory and real-time-safe processing where applicable.

## Before calling Auto Declip stable

The initial implementation still needs real recordings and generated clipping fixtures beyond the unit tests. Before a stable release, validate:

1. Steinberg validator/test-host behavior,
2. Audacity scan/load and latency compensation,
3. mono/stereo and 32/64-bit paths,
4. block-boundary clipping runs,
5. false-positive rate on hard-limited but intentionally undamaged masters,
6. quality against Audacity Clip Fix and other deterministic baselines.

Neural declipping is a later stage, not a branding sticker glued over an interpolation function.
